2. Navigate to **Supervisor** -> **Add-on Store**
3. Find either:
   - `n8n` for the stable version

4. Click "INSTALL" on your chosen version

# Configuration

```yaml
timezone: Asia/Bangkok
env_vars_list: []
cmd_line_args: ""
```

## Required Settings

### `env_vars_list`
Add environment variables as a list in the addon configuration. Each variable should be on a new line following this format:
```yaml
env_vars_list:
  - "TIMEZONE: Asia/Bangkok"
  - "N8N_HOST: localhost"
  - "N8N_PORT: 5678"
  - "NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL: moment,lodash"
  - "WEBHOOK_URL: https://your-tunnel-url.com"
```


[View all available environment variables](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/environment-variables/environment-variables/)

### External Packages
To use external npm packages, add them to `env_vars_list`:
```yaml
env_vars_list:
  - "NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL: axios,moment,lodash"
```

Multiple packages should be comma-separated without spaces.

## Network Configuration

### Webhooks and API Access
For secure external access to webhooks and the n8n API, we strongly recommend using Cloudflared:

1. Install [Cloudflared addon](https://github.com/racksync/hass-addons-suite)
2. Create a tunnel for port 7123 (webhook/API port)
3. Add the tunnel URL to your configuration:
```yaml
env_vars_list:
  - "WEBHOOK_URL: https://your-tunnel.cloudflare.com"
```

Benefits of using Cloudflared:
- üîí Secure HTTPS endpoint
- üåç Global CDN access
- üõ°Ô∏è DDoS protection
- üîë Zero trust security
- üö´ No port forwarding needed

### Remote Access
- For Nabu Casa: Set `EXTERNAL_URL` to your remote URL
- For manual setup: Configure port 5678 in the Network section

# Quick Start

1. Install the addon
2. Start it from the Home Assistant interface
3. Access n8n through the addon's Web UI
4. Set up Cloudflared tunnel for webhooks (recommended)
5. Begin creating your first workflow!

üí° **Pro Tip**: Set up the Cloudflared tunnel before creating workflows that use webhooks or external triggers. This ensures your workflows will have secure, reliable external access from the start.
